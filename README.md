# MuseOS

A Distro-Project for making a superior, lightweight, easy to use Linux Studio with working name "MuseOS". 

It will be aimed at Audio and Music only. With the obvious options of installing any other wanted software.

Revision 1 will be Debian-Based but use a super-lightweight Desktop Manager. Inspiration will be taken from Arch Linux 
to Ubuntu Studio and beyond.

It will sport a low-latency or a real-time kernel. Include tons of free, integrated Music Programs. 
The best tools and plugins from every conceivable source. 

Jack, OSS, PulseAudio, ALSA and others will all be set up to work in harmony with the included software.

Included software will be programs like LMMS, Ardour, Milky Tracker, ShismTracker, ProTrekkr, Musescore, Audacity,
Audacious, SunVox, Rosegarden, Cecilia, FFADO and more. Options for Renoise and other pay-to-play software 
compatible with Linux will be just a few clicks away.

Plugins will consist of Linux VST, Windows VST via WINE, LADSPA, DSSI, Lv2 and more. Studio-Packages like KxStudio,
Calf-Plugins, and others will be included, as will the best of the Ubuntu Studio Audio-System, among other Studio-Distros.

I have experimented with combining Ubuntu Studio with Linux Mint and assorted software and Studio Packages for a long time.
- Results are good, but messy.

Assistance is not just appreciated, it is wanted, and needed.
